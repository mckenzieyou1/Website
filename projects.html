<h2>Kruskal’s Algorithm Simulator | Java Project October 2023 - November 2023</h2>
<li>Developed a Java-based simulator for Kruskal’s Algorithm, integrating Map and Set classes using WeissBST for efficient
    graph representation.</li>
<li> Implemented an Undirected Graph class supporting graph editing and information retrieval, and completed the Kruskal’s
    MST Algorithm for step-by-step visualization.</li>
<li> Utilized established libraries such as Java Collections Framework and JUNG for graph visualization in the simulator.</li>
   <h2> Order Management System | C Project October 2023 - November 2023</h2>
    <li>In this project I designed and implemented a C program to create an Order Management System enabling efficient
    tracking and management orders.</li>
  <li>Demonstrated a strong proficiency in working with linked lists by developing functions for adding, deleting, displaying,
    modifying, and merging orders.</li>
   <li>Ensured program reliability by implementing memory leak-free code verified with Valgrind, highlighting attention to
    detail and commitment to code quality.</li>
   <h2> Trailblazer Chatbot Project | PatriotHacks: https://lnkd.in/gyRFmg4f October 2023 - October 2023 </h2>
    <li> My team and I created a chatbot that leverages the AWS Lex Chat Bot and AWS Lambda Services to query a MySQL database hosted on RDS to recommend nearby trails to hike.</li>
    <li>I was responsible for the backend development, where I integrated the chatbot with the lambda function.</li>
   <li> I configured the utterances, slots, and formulated chatbot responses.</li>
